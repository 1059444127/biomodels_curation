# This file is mainly used to annotate reactions and their products. However,
# it can also be used to describe modifications to names without reactions.
# In this case, 
#
# Reactant	: regex to match the reactant
# Product	: substitution pattern to match the product
# MIRIAM-URN_R	: describing the reaction (e.g. proteolytic cleavage)
# sboTerm_R	: describing the reaction
# reaction_type	: identity - product will get the same annotation as reactant
#		  modification - product will get modified qualifier
#		  addition;<urn> - product will get hasPart of new and old urns
#		  transport;<urn> - sets occursIn(?)
